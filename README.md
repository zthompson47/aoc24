Solutions for 2024 Advent of Code.

*TODO*

**Day 17**
Not sure why the solution works.  Going backwards and multiplying
each found `a` by `8` gets close enough to the next `a` for a
fast search. Why? Probably need to interpret what all the bitwise
xor stuff does.

**Day 18**
Takes a long time but got the answer.  Should be a lot faster (?) but
didn't figure out how to optimize the large blocks of empty space.
